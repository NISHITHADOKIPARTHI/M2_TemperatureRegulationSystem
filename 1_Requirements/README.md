As the quality of life improves, people have higher and higher requirements for comfort andintelligence of driving cars, in the cold winter, the internal temperature of the car is low, especially when the car first started, the air conditioning temperature will take a long time to reach thestandard, the car heating pad have rapid heating, good control and adaptability, which can greatlyimprove the comfort of driver and passenger. At present, the temperature control of automobile heating pad is mostly realized through the construction of analog circuit or the control of single-chip computer, through the switch to control heating, through the knob to control the heating temperature, this paper design an intelligent temperature control system of heating pad based on expert control, using expert experience, control the heating pad temperature in real time according to the vehicle environment temperature and the driver's physical characteristics, at the same time, it has self-protection functions such as over-current, under-pressure, over-pressure and over-temperature, so as to improve the comfort and safety of drivers and passengers.
